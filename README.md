Firstly I started off with a header ssection. I took the svgs and images from the site itself and placed them accordingly on the header. additionally i used javascript to make a dropdown and a container that reacts when clicked on. added some animations and completed it. next was language switcher which was a simple dropdown code. 
Next i went on to the big concept image. I used the iamge again from site and added the css to closely resemble it off the site. I copied someo off the css and added some for the effect of hover on the button.
then was a simple text nothing special was done.
Following we had a grid of photos. I used css to make them look like the original used the original sites css to adjust some things and gave it responsivnes to make them vertically lined up when on mobile.
The 3 divs where again nothing special, also i gave them responsivness to become vertical when on mobile.
The most tricky part was the swiper for sure. i used swiperjs to make it and had to tweak the css for it to become as close to the original as possible.
Next part is the appstore part where an image,text and a link was used. button was copied from the original and tweaked by css. the responsivness allowes it to become vertical once more on the mobile.
Then again we used a swiper but with different cards. this time they didnt have logos and text was different.
This section was copied from the second section as it was exactly the same.
Again, swiper but with just logos this time and no big image.
Lastly to end a site we have a footer which has all the neccessary info as well as language changer and a facebook/instagram link.
